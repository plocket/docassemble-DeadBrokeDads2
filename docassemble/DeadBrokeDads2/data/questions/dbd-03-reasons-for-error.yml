question: |
  Look at the printout you got from DOR
subquestion: |
  Look at the printout you got from DOR/CSE.
  
  Does this look right to you? 
  
  One of the most common reasons for people to fall behind in child support is that the order changed and either:	
  
  * You did not know the order changed,  or 
  * DOR/CSE did not know the order changed.

  Events that may have caused your child support problem
subquestion: |
  Your child support order could have changed and:
  
  * you did not know about it, or
  * DOR/CSE did not know about it.
