id: dbd 04 first fell behind date
question: |
  When was the first time you fell behind on child support payments?
subquestion: |
  Barb - if obligor says they never fell behind, but DCF says they did, should we ask them to find out when DCF thinks they fell behind? This is so obligor can get the bank levy and say DCF took money out of the account or froze it while obligor was getting benefits - we need this question for equitable adjustment.

  Representative Payee: |
    Sometimes a person who gets money from Social Security needs help managing their money.  The person who helps is called a Representative Payee.  The Social Security Administration (SSA) gives the beneficiary's money to the Rep Payee so the payee can spend it to pay for the beneficiary's needs. The payee keeps the money in a bank account for or with the beneficiary. The money is not kept in the payee's own account.
