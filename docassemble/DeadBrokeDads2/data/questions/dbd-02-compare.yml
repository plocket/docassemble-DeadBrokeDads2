question: |
  What does the Notice of Delinquent Child Support from DOR/CSE say?
subquestion: |
  These notices can be confusing. 
  
  The amount under ${other_parent.name.first}'s name,  is supposed to be your regular child support payment.

  In the middle is how often you are supposed to pay child support.

  The amount on the right is the amount of back child support that DOR CSE says you owe. This amount also includes any interest and penalties DOR CSE is charging you.
  
  What does DOR/CSE say these are?
  The notice should look something like this:
  [FILE DBD_NoticeTop.png]
fields:
  - 1. What is the date?: notice_date_delinquency
    datatype: date 
  - 2. Is the custodial parent's name **${other_parent.name}**?: other_parent_wrong

    datatype: noyesradio   
  - What is the name of the court at the top of your latest child support order?: cs_court

  - What does your latest order say you must pay?: cs_amount
    datatype: currency

  - Does the court order say you must pay  ${dbd_period_string(dor_cse_notice_frequency)} : dor_cse_notice_frequency_wrong

  - How often does your order say you must pay child support?: cs_frequency
    datatype: number

    show if: dor_cse_notice_frequency_wrong
  - Do you owe ${currency(dor_cse_notice_arrears)} in back child support? : dor_cse_notice_arrears_wrong

  - note: Note on arrears amount. If you do owe back child support, this amount may be different from your calculation because it includes ${currency(arrears_state)} penalties and interest on top of any back child support you owe.

question: |
  Did you ever pay late?
subquestion: |
  Have you ever fallen behind on child support payments?
field: cs_arrears_mc
choices:
  - Yes
  - No
  - I am not sure
---
question: |
  Do you have any proof?
subquestion: |
  Can you show DOR that you never fell behind and always paid all the child support you owed? You can use: 
  
  * bank statements,
  * paystubs,
  * court orders,
  * receipts, and 
  * W2s.
yesno: documentation
---
event: more_info_needed
question: |
  You need more information or documentation
subquestion: |
  1. Go to the Court, 
  2. Get copies of **all** court orders, and
  *Caroline question: **all child support orders, or all P & F court orders that obligor was a party in, or orders in all courts?***
  3. If applicable—give **all** copies to DOR immediately. 
  
  DOR may recalculate the amount of back child support you owe based on the documentation you give them. 
  
  If you think there is something wrong with the Court order(s) itself, and not DOR, you may need to file something with the Court instead of talking to DOR.
