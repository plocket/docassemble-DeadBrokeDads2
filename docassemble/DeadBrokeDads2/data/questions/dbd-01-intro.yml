  We can help you fill out the forms you need if:  
  
  * The Department of Revenue Child Support Enforcement (DOR/CSE) sent you a notice that says that you are behind in child support payments. That notice is called a [Notice of Child Support Delinquency](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eFI1jrzWLGSMA094sveue-TOFswCnMcG/view?usp=sharing). 
  * DOR/CSE  took your tax refund.

  * DOR/CSE told you or your employer the amount of child support you need to pay is going up by 25%.

  We **cannot help you change the amount of child support you owe your child’s other parent**. 
  
  If you need to change the amount of the child support order, you will need to go to court. See [Changing a Child Support Order](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/children-and-families/child-support-changing-it) on MassLegalHelp.
  
  We can only help you with one child support order at a time. 
  
  If you owe back child support to more than one parent, you will need to start over with a new interview for each parent.
