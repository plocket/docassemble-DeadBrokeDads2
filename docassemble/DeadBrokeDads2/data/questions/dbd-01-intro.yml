section: Introduction
question: | 
  Welcome!
subquestion: |
  If DOR/CSE sent you a Notice of Child Support Delinquency you may not have to pay **everything** on the notice. 
  
    They can decide not to charge you:

    * interest, (?)
    * penalties,
    * the amount of child support you owe them.* 

    They can also undo actions they have taken that make it hard for you to pay overdue child support.
    
    We will ask you questions to help you fill out the forms you need to get help with the money DOR says you them.

  Shall we get started?
yesno: get_started
under: |
  Note: Just to be clear -  we can **only** help with money you owe the Department of Revenue. 
  You must still pay any back child support you owe your child's other parent.

question: |
  Modify your child support order
subquestion: |
  If:
    * you cannot pay the amount of child support the court ordered you to pay and

    * things have changed since the court made the child support order, ask the court to change the order.

  Offer in Settlement

  You may be able to make a “settlement” with DOR/CSE for past-due child support.  DOR/CSE will **not** make a settlement with you about past-due child support you owe ${ other_parent.name.first }. 
  
  See <a href="https://www.masslegalhelp.org/children-and-families/child-support-dor/pay-past-due" target="_blank">Can DOR/CSE let me pay less past-due child support than I owe?</a> to learn more.

  Do you want to work on the Statement of Financial Condition?
